Alien Invasion Game Summary
Modules Used:

pygame for game functionality
sys to handle exiting the game
Game Structure:

The game is built as a class called AlienInvasion.
In the __init__() method:
pygame.init() sets up Pygame.
pygame.display.set_mode((1200, 800)) creates the game window.
The window is stored in self.screen, a Pygame surface used for drawing.
Game Loop (run_game() method):

A while loop runs continuously to keep the game active.
Inside it, a for loop (event loop) checks for user actions like key presses or window closing.
pygame.event.get() retrieves recent events.
If the player quits, sys.exit() is called to close the game.
Screen Updates:

pygame.display.flip() refreshes the screen to show the latest game state, enabling smooth animation.
Execution:

At the bottom of the file, an instance of AlienInvasion is created and run_game() is called if the script is run directly.
